/**
 * Provides type-safe methods for interacting with the CRADLE server API.
 *
 * Each method is written as a `suspend` function which is executed using the
 * [IO] dispatcher and returns a [NetworkResult]. In general, a method will
 * return a [Success] variant with the desired return value wrapped inside if
 * the server was able to successfully respond to the request. A [Failure]
 * return value means that the request made it to the server, but the server
 * responded with an error and was not able to complete the request. This
 * happens when the requested resource cannot be found for example. A
 * [NetworkException] return value means that the networking driver ([Http])
 * threw an exception when sending the request or handling the response.
 * A timeout is one such cause of an exception for example.
