Android application for the CRADLE VSA System, a technological health care system
to improve maternal care and reduce preventable maternal deaths in Ugandan villages.

The Cradle VSA (Vital Signs Alert) is a portable medical device that can read a 
patientâ€™s blood pressure and heart rate, mainly used to detect abnormalities 
during pregnancy. The Cradle VSA application can record the readings taken by 
the Cradle VSA device and upload it to the server. Our application is designed 
for remote areas with an unstable internet connection; thus, so we implemented 
an SMS feature.
